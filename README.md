# Mars Rover Project using TDD and TypeScript

👾 🚀 You are working in an Engineering Squad for the 🎶 Melody Mars Mission,
tasked with designing software to manage robots 🤖 and cool vehicles for space

exploration! 👽 🛸🌏

## 1️⃣ Setting the Scene

You have been asked to create a program to move rovers around the surface of Mars!
✨
The surface of Mars is represented by a Plateau. You can make the assumption that the
Plateau is a square/rectangular grid for the purpose of this task.
Rovers navigate the Plateau so they can use their special cameras 📷 and robot arms
🦾 to collect samples back to Planet Earth 🌏

## 2️⃣ Your Task

👉 Create a scalable, production-quality program which implements the rules for the Mars Rover, which can be
found in the attached document at the end of this brief.
👉 Use Test-Driven Development (TDD) for unit test coverage with all unit tests passing.

## 3️⃣ How the Mars Rover Works

🗺 Representation of a Rover’s Position on the Plateau
The Plateau is divided into a grid. A Rover’s position is represented by x and y
co-ordinates and the letters N, S, W, E to represent North, South, West, East (the four
cardinal compass points) respectively, with bottom-left, facing North being 0 0 N.

Move the Rover around using the input commands and ouutput the final position.
